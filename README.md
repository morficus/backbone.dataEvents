# Backbone.dataEvents
Inspired by Backbone.Marionette's [modelEvents and collectionEvents](http://marionettejs.com/docs/marionette.view.html#viewmodelevents-and-viewcollectionevents)
> Similar to the events hash, views can specify a configuration hash for collections and models. The left side is the event on the model or collection, and the right side is the name of the method on the view.
